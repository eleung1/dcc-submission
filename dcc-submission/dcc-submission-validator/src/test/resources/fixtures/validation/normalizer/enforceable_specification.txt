# format for this enforceable spec:
#
# - comments (starting with '#') and empty lines will be ignored
# - this file will be split in two files (input versus result) based on the first column
# - the "comment" column will be discarded
# - short names for fields will be replaced by their real counterpart (ctr -> control_genotype)
# - missing fields will be populated with dummy data (chromosome start, quality_score, ...) since they're not relevant here
# - fields will be reordered to match the order of the dictionary
# - a test will run on the re-formatted input file and be checked against the re-formatted result file
# - for "input" type, leave the "mut" and "marking" columns empty (they're considered N/A)
# - put result row(s) right after their corresponding input row
# - separate input+result rows islands with a new line

# TODO: explain CTRL

type	ref	ctr	tmr	frm	to	mut	marking	comment

input	A	A/A	A/C	A	C			simplest case
result	A	A/A	A/C	A	C	A>C	OPEN	

input	A	A/G	A/C	A	C			one sensitive allele in control
result	A	A/G	A/C	A	C	A>C	CTRL	
result	A			A	C	A>C	MASK	

input	A	A/G	A/C	G	C			same but the "other" control allele is chosen as "from"
result	A	A/G	A/C	G	C	A>C	CTRL	
result	A			G	C	A>C	MASK	is that correct?
