# format for this enforceable spec:
#
# - Comments (starting with '#') and empty lines will be ignored
# - As much as possible, we try and make sure the columns are aligned on a basic editor that uses 4 spaces for tabs
# - This file will be split in two files (input versus result) based on the first column
# - The "comment" column will be discarded
# - Short names for fields will be replaced by their real counterpart (ctr -> control_genotype)
# - Missing fields will be populated with dummy data (chromosome start, quality_score, ...) since they're not relevant here
# - Fields will be reordered to match the order of the dictionary
# - A test will run on the re-formatted input file and be checked against the re-formatted result file
# - For "input" type, leave the "mut" and "marking" columns empty (they're considered N/A)
# - Put result row(s) right after their corresponding input row
# - Separate input+result rows islands with a new line
# - The "marking" column uses the abbreviations "OPEN", "CTRL" and "MASK" for "OPEN", "CONTROLLED" and "MASKED" respectively
# 
# Example:
#
# Input:
# 
# 	input	1	A	A/G	A/C	G	C
#   
# Translates to:
# 
#     input:	Indicates that the row is an input
#     1:		Mutation type of "1" (substitution)
#     A:		Reference genome allele A; Note that position isn't relevant here
#     A/G:		Control genotype with alleles A and G
#     A/C:		Tumour genotype with alleles A and C
#     G:		Mutated "from" allele G (must be one of the alleles in the control genotype)
#     C:  		Mutated "to" allele C (must be one of the alleles in the tumour genotype)
# 
# Refer to dictionary for the exact rules governing the values allows for each field and with respected to one another.
# 
# Expected result (s):
# 
# 	result	1	A	A/G	A/C	G	C	G>C	CTRL
# 	...
# 
# Which translate to:
# 
# 	result:		Indicate that the row is one of the expected result for the input above (there can be more than one resulting row)
# 	...
# 	G>C:		The resulting mutation computed as the concatenation of the mutated "from" and the mutated "to" alleles
# 	CTRL:		Indicates that the observation described is expected to be marked as "CONTROLLED"
# 
# This particular input would also generate a "masked" result like so:
# 
# 	result	1	A			A	C	A>C	MASK
# 	
# Which is the same as the "CONTROLLED" counterpart with 3 differences: the row is marked with "MASK" and both control/tumour genotypes are emptied
