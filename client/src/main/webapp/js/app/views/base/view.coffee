      # Template compilation
      # --------------------

      # This demo uses Handlebars templates to render views.
      # The template is loaded with Require.JS and stored as string on
      # the view prototype. On rendering, it is compiled on the
      # client-side. The compiled template function replaces the string
      # on the view prototype.
      #
      # In the end you might want to precompile the templates to JavaScript
      # functions on the server-side and just load the JavaScript code.
      # Several precompilers create a global JST hash which stores the
      # template functions. You can get the function by the template name:
      #
      # templateFunc = JST[@templateName]

        # Compile the template string to a function and save it
        # on the prototype. This is a workaround since an instance
        # shouldnâ€™t change its prototype normally.
