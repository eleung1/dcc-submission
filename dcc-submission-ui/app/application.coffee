  # Instantiate common controllers
  # ------------------------------
  initControllers: ->
    # These controllers are active during the whole application runtime.
    # You don’t need to instantiate all controllers here, only special
    # controllers which do not to respond to routes. They may govern models
    # and views which are needed the whole time, for example header, footer
    # or navigation views.
    # e.g. new NavigationController()
    new SessionController()

  # Create additional mediator properties
