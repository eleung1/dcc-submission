# ICGC DCC - Submission Core

Core classes for the data submission sub-system.

*Note:* This is an incomplete module due to cyclic dependencies between `dcc-submission-server`. Eventually these relationships will be detangled to provide a clean separation.

## Build

To compile, test and package the module, execute the following from the root of the repository:

```shell
mvn -am -pl dcc-submission/dcc-submission-core
```
